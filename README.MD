## 🌐 Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure

**Iris C2** is a **next-generation C2 infrastructure**, designed to orchestrate **botnets** and/or **dedicated servers** with **remarkable efficiency**. The goal? To steal **sensitive information** without the victims' knowledge and send it to a central server equipped with the following tools:
- **RAT** (Remote Access Trojan)
- **Stealer** (for data theft)
- **Crypto-Miner XMR** (for silent Monero mining)

All of this ensures **optimal and discreet** exploitation of the infected machine(s) or server(s).

## 🛠️ Features

Iris C2 is equipped with several powerful tools to ensure efficient exploitation of infected resources:

### 🧑‍💻 **Main Tools**:
- **RAT**: Full remote access to infected machines.
- **Stealer**: Theft of sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, etc.
- **Crypto-Miner XMR**: Monero mining on infected machines.

### 🕶️ **Discretion and Security**:
The Iris C2 infrastructure uses **advanced technologies** to ensure **invisibility and undetectability**:

- **Advanced Obfuscation** 🔒: Makes the code hard to analyze and detect.
- **Dropper** 🛑: Deploys malware without being detected.
- **Ultra-Efficient Parsing** 🧹: Circumvents security mechanisms to avoid detection.

## 🖥️ **Remote Management**

The **C2** server centralizes the sending of commands to **infected agents** or **dedicated servers**. This allows **full remote control** with autonomous management of infected resources, all in **real-time**.

### 📡 **System Commands**:
- Sends commands remotely to infected agents.
- Updates and manages infected dedicated servers.
- Automates the infection and exploitation processes.

## 🏴‍☠️ **Invisibility and Undetectability**

**Iris C2** ensures that **all operations remain undetectable** through advanced masking techniques. The infrastructure is **invisible**, making detection extremely difficult thanks to **sophisticated systems**:

- **Advanced Obfuscation** to avoid code analysis.
- **Dropper System** to evade detection during deployment.
- **Ultra-Efficient Parsing** to bypass security mechanisms and avoid detection by antivirus programs.
