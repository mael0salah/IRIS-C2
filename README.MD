## 🌐・Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure :

**Iris C2** is a **next-generation C2 infrastructure**, designed to orchestrate **botnets** and/or **dedicated servers** with **remarkable efficiency**. The goal? To stealthily **steal sensitive information** without the victims' knowledge and send it to a central server equipped with the following powerful tools:
- **🖥️ RAT** (Remote Access Trojan) : Full control over infected systems.
- **🔐 Stealer** : Secure theft of sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, etc.
- **💰 Crypto-Miner XMR** : Stealthy Monero mining using the infected machine.

These tools work together to ensure **optimal exploitation** of infected machines or servers, all while staying **undetected**. 🔒

## 🛠️・Features :

Iris C2 is packed with an arsenal of **advanced features** for efficient and discreet exploitation:

### 🧑‍💻・**Main Tools** :

- **🖥️ RAT** : Gain **full remote access** to the infected machines, execute commands, and control the system.
- **🔐 Stealer** : Extract **confidential data** such as passwords, tokens, and other private information.
- **💰 Crypto-Miner XMR** : Silent **Monero mining**, harnessing the power of compromised systems to generate profit.

### 🕶️・**Discretion and Security** :
Maintaining **invisibility** is a core feature of **Iris C2**. The system employs the latest **security evasion techniques** to stay undetectable:

- 🔒 **Advanced Obfuscation** : Makes the malicious code **virtually invisible** to analysis tools.
- 🛑 **Dropper** : Deploys the malware on the victim’s system **without triggering any alarms**.
- 🧹 **Ultra-Efficient Parsing** : Circumvents detection by security software and firewalls, ensuring smooth execution.

## 🖥️・Remote Management :

The **C2 server** acts as the **centralized brain**, sending **real-time commands** to the infected agents and servers. This enables **full remote control** and **autonomous management** of compromised resources:

### 📡・**System Commands** :
- Sends **remote commands** to agents and infected systems.
- Manages and updates the **dedicated servers**.
- Automates the entire **infection and exploitation process**.

## 🏴‍☠️・Invisibility and Undetectability :

Iris C2 ensures that all **operations remain completely undetected**. The system is **designed for stealth**, making detection almost **impossible** through the use of advanced evasion techniques:

- 🔒 **Advanced Obfuscation**: Keeps the **code hidden** from traditional detection methods.
- 🛑 **Dropper System**: Installs malware while **avoiding detection** during deployment.
- 🧹 **Ultra-Efficient Parsing**: Continuously **bypasses security measures**, preventing detection by antivirus software and firewalls.
